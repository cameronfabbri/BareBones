Things which I need to know/do:

For everything I implement, also upload a complimentary derivation I did in latex.

gradient descent on simple gaussian distribution for estimating the
parameters of some dataset - think height example

write up a vector/matrix class with everything like inverse, transpose,
multiplication, etc.

Find a good plotting library to visualize results and stuff.

covariance matrix
normal distribution function
random sample
tsne
momentum
backprop
sift features
orb detector
hog features
